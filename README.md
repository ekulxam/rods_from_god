I am the kinetic bombardment that is approaching...

This project adds miscellaneous superweapons for modfest.

Items / Blocks / Entities
1. Aiming Device and Tungsten Rods - The aiming device is an item that "aims" the Tungsten Rods. Right-click on a block to summon a landing marker, which tells players where the rod will land. The rod will hit the ground shortly after and explode. Explosion power (damage and knockback), an inverse damage factor, creating fire, cooldown, and maximum explosions are all configurable via item components on the aiming device or directly through NBT for the rod.
2. Splash Potion of Lightning - Lightning Splash Potions can be brewed with any Splash Potion (even mundane, water, awkward, thick, etc.) and a lightning rod. The new lightning potion will keep the effects of the splash potion it was brewed with.
3. Super Bouncy Slime Block - A nerfed version of the bouncy castle option from 23w13a_or_b (only launches you ~100 blocks maximum). It is crafted with 4 slime blocks in a square pattern.
4. Corrupted Star Fragment - Crafted from one creeper head and one nether star. Upon death, stops the death, freezes the player in place, makes them explode after a few ticks, and then really kills them.

Created for Modfest 1.21. This mod requires Sinytra Connector and FFAPI (Forgified Fabric API) on NeoForge.
