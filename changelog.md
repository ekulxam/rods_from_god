Rods from God 1.0.1
 - fixed inverseExplosionDamageFactor dividing by 0 sometimes
 - Added a Tungsten Rod Landing Marker to make it more obvious where a Tungsten Rod will land
 - Added some Data Component Types for the Aiming Device to more easily control some of the nbt data of the summoned entity
 - Actually implemented DeathExplosionComponent
 - Added one Data Component Type that makes you invincible against most damage sources (it's supposed to be a bug, but it's a feature now, I guess). I'll fix this later (or not, we'll see).
 - Added Splash Potions of Lightning, which can be brewed with any Splash Potion and a lightning rod. The new lightning potion will keep the effects of the splash potion it was brewed with.
 - Added Super Bouncy Slime Block, a nerfed version of the bouncy castle option from 23w13a_or_b (only launches you ~100 blocks maximum). It is crafted with 4 slime blocks in a square pattern.
