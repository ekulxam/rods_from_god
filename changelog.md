Rods from God 2.0.0+1.21.1
 - BREAKING CHANGES TO CUSTOM COMPONENTS AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS!!! BACK UP YOUR WORLD!
 - Rewrote the mod to use AtmosphericAPI
 - Implemented the Archimedes Lever
 - Start working on datafixer so that the component changes don't break previous worlds, but I can't find motivation to learn how to DFU (DataFixerUpper)
   - You know what, the datafixer can go shove itself in the corner for now, it's blanketcon time (⌐□_□)
 - Buff smoke bomb overlay (overlay now lasts longer and cannot be prevented by hiding the hud)
 - Smoke Bombs can now be dispensed as projectiles
 - Fixed some translations
 - Super Bouncy Slime Blocks can now be dyed and come in all 16 vanilla dye colors
